# GamaGama

The `gamagama` (Game Master Game Manager) organization is developing a set of tools to be used by a Game Master to help run a tabletop RPG. At the moment, the following are available:

- **`gamagama-pdf`**: PDF file extraction into .md and .json for further processing
- **`gamagama-rules`** Natural language rule queries
- **`gamagama-cli`**: Interactive command-line tool to help run a tabletop RPG

The goal of `gamagama` is to provide generic tools useful for any gaming system, through a series of customizations. Systems supported to date are:

- Rolemaster (RMU)
-
